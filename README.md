# Python Basics Tutorial

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial for learning Python basics, covering fundamental concepts through practical examples and exercises.

## Introduction

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. This tutorial is designed for beginners to build a strong foundation in Python programming, progressing from basic syntax to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming and data handling.

## Folder Structure

The tutorial is organized into numbered folders, each focusing on a specific topic:

- **01_Basics/**: Introduction to basic Python syntax, variables, and simple programs.
- **02_Numbers/**: Working with numeric data types and mathematical operations.
- **03_set/**: Understanding sets and set operations in Python.
- **04_Strings/**: String manipulation, formatting, and operations.
- **05_Conditional Problem/**: Conditional statements and decision-making logic.
- **06_Loops/**: Loops (for, while) and iteration techniques.
- **07_Functions/**: Defining and using functions, parameters, and return values.
- **08_Scopes Closure/**: Variable scopes, closures, and nested functions.
- **09_OOP/**: Object-oriented programming concepts: classes, objects, inheritance.
- **10_Decorators/**: Decorators and function wrappers.
- **11_Handling_Api/**: Working with APIs and external data sources.
- **12_PY_Mongo/**: Integration with MongoDB for database operations.
- **13_virtual_py/**: Virtual environments and project management.
- **PY Project/**: A complete project example demonstrating practical application.

## Topics Covered

Based on the content in the folders:

- **Data Types**: Numbers, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries (detailed in dataTypes.md)
- **Basic Programming**: Printing output, defining functions, and variable usage
- **Control Structures**: Conditionals and loops for program flow
- **Functions and Scopes**: Reusable code blocks and variable visibility
- **Advanced Concepts**: OOP, decorators, API handling, database integration
- **Project Management**: Virtual environments and real-world project structure

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Navigate to each folder in sequence to follow the tutorial progression.
3. Run the Python scripts using `python filename.py` in your terminal.
4. Review the code comments and experiment with modifications.

## Examples

Here's a simple example from the basics section:

```python
print("Rishi Rana")

def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Rishi Rana")
```

This demonstrates basic output, function definition, and function calls.

## Contributing

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon these examples. Each section builds upon the previous ones, so following the order is recommended for the best learning experience.
